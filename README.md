# AI Flip Four

AI Flip Four is a strategic game based on the popular Connect Four game, enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Players can compete against each other or face off against AI agents, including Minimax and Q-Learning, each with unique strategies. This project explores the integration of reinforcement learning, search algorithms, and user-friendly graphical interfaces.

## Features

- **Game Modes**: Play against Minimax AI, Play against Q-Learning AI, or Watch the AI Algorithms compete.
- **AI Agents**: 
  - **Minimax**: A classic decision-making algorithm.
  - **Q-Learning**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that learns optimal strategies through trial and error.
- **Game Visualization**: A graphical user interface (GUI) created using Pygame, providing an interactive experience.
- **Save and Load Data**: Supports saving and loading learning data for Q-Learning agents using Pickle files.
- **Game Customization**: Option to flip the board at certain intervals, adding an extra layer of complexity.
